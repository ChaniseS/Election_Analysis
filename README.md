# Election_Analysis

## Overview of the Election Audit:
Seth and Tom were happy with the Election Audit results we provided. However, once they submitted the results to the Election Commission, they requested some additional data for the counties. For this project, I was asked to gather the below information to submit to the Election Commission:

- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout

## Election Audit Results:
Below is a complete breakdown of my script and the results that shows the Outcome of the Election for both the Candidates and the Counties.

1.	How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

## Election-Audit Summary:
-	In Summary Diana DeGette won the Election by a landslide! 
With some minor adjustments/modifications, this script can be reused to provide the vote count by candidate and county for future elections.
    - One modification would be adjusting the load file path. Currently we are using the ‘Election_Results.csv” file in the Resources folder. Simplify update the location of the document you would like the script to pull information from and you’re good to go. 
See screenshot to see where to update your code:
